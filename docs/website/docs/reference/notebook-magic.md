# Command Line Interface for DLT in IPython Notebooks

The DLT (Data Loading Tool) Command Line Interface (CLI) can be seamlessly integrated into IPython notebooks, enabling a more interactive and visual approach to managing and deploying data pipelines.

## `%init`

In an IPython notebook, you can use the `%init` magic command to execute the `dlt init` command. This command sets up a new DLT pipeline script that transfers data from a `source` to a `destination`.

```ipython
%init --source <source>  --destionation <destination>

```

## `%pipeline`

In an IPython notebook, you can use the `%init` magic command to execute the `dlt init` command. This command sets up a new DLT pipeline script that transfers data from a `source` to a `destination`.

```ipython
%init --source <source>  --destionation <destination>

```

## `%pipeline`

In an IPython notebook, you can use the `%init` magic command to execute the `dlt init` command. This command sets up a new DLT pipeline script that transfers data from a `source` to a `destination`.

```ipython
%init --source <source>  --destionation <destination>
